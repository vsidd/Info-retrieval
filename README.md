# Info-retrieval
Implemented and compared various retrieval systems using vector space models and language models.
This project uses elasticsearch, a commercial-grade indexer.  
The project has two objectives:
* To parse the corpus and index it with elasticsearch
* To create a query processor, which runs queries from an input file using a selected retrieval model
